-- opacity
The opacity property in CSS is used to set the transparency level of an element. It ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque).

opacity: 0: This makes the element fully transparent, meaning it's invisible but still takes up space in the layout.

opacity: 1: This makes the element fully opaque, meaning it's completely visible and solid.
